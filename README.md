# iris-flower
**Objective**: 
To develop a predictive model using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with highest accuracy without any overfitting risk, which classify Iris flower species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
**Dataset**: 
Iris flower dataset, consisting of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
**Methodology**:
Utilize XGBoost classifier for model training. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
